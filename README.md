## Interaction Description

The interaction I'm exploring is teleporting/moving in VR.
The ways I'm going to implement it are 
1) The player aims with the controller to a special object acts as a grappling hook that lets the player 'pull' themselves forward in space
2) The player shoots an object in an arc and teleports wherever object lands
3) If the player stares at one place for longer, a progress bar charges up. Before the charge runs out, the player has to rotate their hand to 'tune' into being able to teleport before pulling the trigger to teleport. The longer the player stares at a target, the faster the hand rotation will lock in the teleport.
