## Interaction Description

The interaction I'm exploring is teleporting/moving in VR.
The ways I'm going to implement it are 
1) The player aims with the controller to a special object acts as a grappling hook that lets the player 'pull' themselves forward in space
2) The player shoots an object and teleports wherever object lands
3) The player teleports by aiming and selecting where they want to move to.

## Testing Questions
Pre Questions:
1) How familiar are you with using VR?
* Tester 1: never a headset, used friends beatsaber
* Tester 2: very familiar
* Tester 3: somwewhate, went to VR arcades
* Tester 4: somewhat familiar
* Tester 5: from class

2) How do you typically move in VR? (continuous movement, teleportation, jumping, flying, etc)
* Tester 1: joystick continuous, teleportation makes the most sense simple
* Tester 2: continuous movement
* Tester 3: walking, move arms to walk
* Tester 4: continuous
* Tester 5: teleporting

3) What makes moving in VR feel immersive to you?
* Tester 1: moving controllers around in space, 
* Tester 2: being able to actually move ur body, if not continuous, teleporting least immersive
* Tester 3: more body involvement
* Tester 4: some kind of haptic feedback vibrations
* Tester 5: mirror human movement

Post Questions:
1) Which interaction felt the best to you?
* Tester 1: last one teleport bc easy to understand
* Tester 2: teleporting at the end felt the most consistent, grappling was the most fun
* Tester 3: grappling
* Tester 4: grappling
* Tester 5: last one

2) Any points that weren't intuitive / were confusing?
* Tester 1: grappling got stuck
* Tester 2: the launching fish, falling throught the floor, there wasn't an explanation
* Tester 3: the second one bc glitchy
* Tester 4: 2nd one falling through floor
* Tester 5: no

3) Which movement method felt like you had the most control? Which one was the most immersive to you?
* Tester 1: the teleport one bc could see where you were giong to be
* Tester 2: the teleporting, the grappling one because it was unique
* Tester 3: the first and the third, the first bc start and finish
* Tester 4: grappling
* Tester 5: last one, grappling
