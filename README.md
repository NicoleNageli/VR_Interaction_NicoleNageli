## Interaction Description

The interaction I'm exploring is teleporting/moving in VR.
The ways I'm going to implement it are 
1) The player aims with the controller to a special object acts as a grappling hook that lets the player 'pull' themselves forward in space
2) The player shoots an object in an arc and teleports wherever object lands
3) The player teleports by selecting where they want to move to.
